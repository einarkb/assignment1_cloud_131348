I had major problems getting the projec tto work with heroku and had to give in at last. there were gopath issues, vendor file issues etc etc etc and I simply could not figure it out.

Also im delivering two versions of the assigenment. The one bigger one with comments etc is the working version whith test success and lint pass. The other one was what i thaught would be a more clever solution that would reqyuire way less coding. It did work in that it did fetch and print the correct information, but there was a runtime error of interface convertion to string i simply couldnt get rid off so I went back to my original version.
